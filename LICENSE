DISCLAIMER

This project is a parody and homage created for educational and entertainment
purposes. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to the
Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (bpb) or their Wahl-O-Mat application.

"Wahl-O-Mat" is a registered trademark of the Bundeszentrale für politische
Bildung. This project uses the name "Wal-O-Mat" as a play on the German words
"Wahl" (election/choice) and "Wal" (whale).

The quiz logic and scoring algorithm are inspired by the publicly documented
methodology of the original Wahl-O-Mat, adapted here for a humorous personality
quiz matching users with whale species rather than political parties.
